## 📂 FOIA Archive: DOJ Release

> [!NOTE]

On December 20, 2025, the U.S Government released a significant volume of files and images related to the Epstein case via the Department of Justice (DOJ) website. Due to extreme public interest, the official government servers are currently experiencing high latency and intermittent downtime.

This repository serves as a high-performance mirror and development toolkit to ensure the public has stable, fast access to these documents.

## Run the Setup
Simply run the following command in your terminal to prepare your environment and start the dev server:

```sh
chmod +x run.sh && ./run.sh
```

This is a community-maintained mirror. While we strive for 1:1 accuracy with the official DOJ release, always verify critical information against the primary source at [justice.gov](https://www.justice.gov/epstein) once their traffic stabilizes.
